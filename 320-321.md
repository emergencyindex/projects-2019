“Old Blue Throat” is the performance of a demonic visitation. It is about the ways inherited trauma manifests in the unconscious as supernatural entities. In the Dream Realm, my childhood in Suva, Fiji was the color blue. I experienced visitations from demonic entities who brought with them psychedelic flowers and temporary paralysis. The entity is the interrogator of performative life and death, a keeper of a violent ancestral legacy.

“Old Blue Throat” is made up of three components—halāhala, offerings of poison from the Ocean of Milk; a Bed of Demons from Vedic literature; and a Bed of Blue Afterlife Flowers. Following the performance, attendees were invited to enter the Dream Realm and take a Blue Flower home to give to their demon.
