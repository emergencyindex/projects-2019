HOW ARE YOU? #Sergina’s Live Participatory Soap Opera about Wrestling with Wellbeing in the Digital Age

Elly Clarke / Vladimir Bjeličić

This was a four hour performance in three acts by Elly Clarke and Vladimir Bjeličić about data entry (and data gathering), labour, and the (female / feminized / performing) body. Set up in a backstage office-like structure, two workers dressed identically in half-drag (hairnets but no wigs; make up but no performance around it) sit on opposite sides of a desk inputting data, their faces projected large onto the walls behind them from their webcams. The data they input is from questions asked directly of the audience that include “What do you feel? What are you feeling right now? What feeling do you evoke? Can you make people feel good? Can you be positive?” The audience can choose to respond in person, on a printed form or via their phones, by following a QR code. The workers never look at each other directly, they communicate exclusively through their screens and the live Zoom video chat that runs for the shift / performance.

During Act 2, in return for cash payments, the workers can be made to leave their chairs to dance from a menu of four #Sergina’s songs, which the paying customer selects. These songs are “I got my phone in my wallet,” “He only wants me for my network,” “Phone me don’t write,” and “I want to see you from a different perspective.” They are about love, lust and loneliness in the digital age and each has a specific outfit and choreographed dance to go with it. The workers take it in turn to respond to the requests, which are announced by the Hostess along with the amount paid for them. The dances take place on the other side of the curtain from the data entry office, making them visible to Saturday afternoon passersby. The dances are live broadcast via @serg1na’s Instagram feed and fed back to the office via a GoPro camera. During Act 3, audience members can request a selfie with #Sergina. Towards the end of the four hours, all data, which has been inputted via Google Forms, is presented to the audience in the form of bar charts, pie charts and percentages. A different video accompanied each act as well as the coffee break.

#Sergina is a character who can be embodied by anybody who dares or desires to be her. The performance took place on a Saturday afternoon in June, 1-5pm.
