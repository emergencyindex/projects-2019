Present Reading

Christalena Hughmanick

Participants of this reading were invited to attend the finnasage event for my solo exhibition of textiles, drawings, and sculptures entitled “Rope a necklace to my tongue” at Faur Zsófi. The intention of this celebration was to both formally close the show and provide context by presenting divination techniques used in the work’s production, which occurred at sites of ancient architecture in Hungary, Spain, and Italy. The primary pieces are quilted, pictorial compositions that draw on the practice’s history of depicting the life experience and surroundings of the quilt maker. A search for personal identity through mysticism and hand making were utilized to compact a viewer’s notion of time.

The reading was presented by “The Truth Guide For A Beginner’s Mind,” an ongoing public performance series that considers the most common and unending of pursuits: to feel satisfied, fulfilled, complete. In this iteration the characteristics of specific species within the animal kingdom were discussed in relation to each participant and used to frame their current positions in the space time continuum. Particular focus was given to the quality of the present moment and the possibility of gleaning information from it. This ancient source of wisdom from the natural world helped participants build a unified and collective intention from a space beyond their individual bodies as seen from an aerial perspective. The overarching intention in this collective action was to make tangible the space between what can be sought and eventually found. In an attempt to navigate necessity and beauty we asked ourselves questions like “How does one attain enough distance from one’s own body to interrupt desire?”
