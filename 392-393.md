imagine her erotics / insignificant, 2019

Izabela Brudkiewicz

“Imagine Her Erotics” is an ongoing series of live installations and videos inspired by the everyday life of an artist mother. This project investigates significant physical and mental metamorphoses that mothers go through every day, by documenting insignificant and mundane moments.

Dressed in black I sat by a table that was covered with a white sheet. On the table, there were a number of items: a bamboo hairbrush, a clear round bowl with a hard boiled egg in it, a clear tall glass of drinking water, and a wooden toothbrush with a pea-size amount of toothpaste on it. I was motionless sitting in the space at first unnoticed. Once the audience realized that I am in the space they all gather in the front of the table, keeping comfortable distance. They created the wall of faces that witness mundane tasks of everyday life. I began to undo hair bun and brush my dark long hair, very slowly taking deep breaths in-between. When my hair was fully brushed and smooth I did the bun on the top of my head again. I stared in the space, breathing deeply and slowly for a few minutes, creating incredible tension in the space. I reached out for the egg that was placed in a glass bowl. Without making eye contact with the audience I smashed the shell and slowly peeled it off. I looked up and bit off the top of an egg. Biting it quite emotionless and slowly. The egg was very dry, it was very difficult to swallow. I forced it through, making the audience uncomfortable. The pieces of the egg were falling ignored, I remained still. Once I finished eating the egg, again I stopped, taking a break for breathing. This pause has increased the intensity of the experience and when the tension was just about to become unbearable. I reached out for the tall glass filled with clear water. I began to drink it, very slowly, as slowly as the tension allowed me. The space was small and full of people. It was incredibly quiet and every sip I took and swallowed could be heard echoing in the void.

Once the water has finished I then slowly put the glass away and I began to breathe for a little while again. I reached for the toothbrush, opened my mouth, and began to brush. I was brushing my teeth very slowly at first, then more violently. The foam was dropping down my neck. I felt the urge to wipe it off clean. I resisted and continued to sit straight. I was brushing my teeth until the foam was gone. I put the brush back on the table and sat still. While I was trying to calm my breath down I was looking bluntly into the void space between me and the audience. After a moment I looked away to the right. The performance was over.
