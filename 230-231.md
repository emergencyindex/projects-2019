Polyphony is music in which autonomous melodies intertwine. A fugue is an example of polyphony—the theme beginning in one style but continually loosening, revealing elements of the fantasy. Every entry of the theme contains an element of uncertainty, yet each seems to be anticipated by the previous one in an unraveling of the limits of straight / linear time-space. solYchaski’s “fugue” is interested in the affirmation of fragments and an alterity that resists interpretation. The score was created before the video, by sampling, composing, and other expanded methods of sound engineering. The performance came to be an audiovisual installation featuring projection, surround sound, and recorded choreography performed in the public of our roof, as well as various other spaces. Relying on distortion as a praxis, the ‘fugue’ is a durational performance formulating an improper history through disorderly assemblage. “fugue” reflects on the echo as an animator of reverberant pasts in the present, and presents in the past, dislocating normative continuity.
