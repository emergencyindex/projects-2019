In the piece, two performers slowly cross a ski area in Tromsø, Norway. They reenact crawling and dragging techniques used in firefighting at a slow and controlled pace. While the audience sits around a bonfire on open air, the performers hide, run, and move each other, following a choreographed circuit in the space. Through reality-based techniques of rescue, the work explores subjects related to global ecology, disaster response, and human agency on natural landscapes.
