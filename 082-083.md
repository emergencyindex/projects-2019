“Becoming Dion (Bundles and Flaming Hots… BITCH!)” is a performative activation of a makeshift interior domestic space that is reminiscent of a bedroom makeup station or vanity desk. Thinking about the act of preparing oneself, about self-care, beauty, and self-desire as a form of healing for femme-identifying fat black queer people.

Within this Activation, I go from presenting masculine to presenting in my most high femme state. I enter the performance presenting masculine, wearing everyday clothes. During the performance I shave my body and facial hair, and apply makeup. I interact with the audience by feeding them flaming hot Cheetos, rubbing shea butter on them, having them assist me to get into femme clothes like my corset, wig, dress, jewelry etc. As I interact with the audience I tell stories of maneuvering in spaces with men, experiences with breakups, and coming to the realization that I was queer at a young age. I sing songs that are referenced in the stories, as the audience continues to help me with my wigs, costumes, and jewelry. The performance normally takes 45 minutes to complete, with me leaving makeup and adornments in the space.
