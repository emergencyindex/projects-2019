The Architecture of a Stream

Valerie Sharp

“The Architecture of a Stream” was my project for a month-long residency at Three Phase Center. I worked with durational stream-of-consciousness writing both as a daily practice and as a performative action. In my writing practice, I strived to be as free and authentic as possible, writing the thoughts that would flow through me in the moment. Throughout the process, I experimented with different “containers” in which to give form to the formless. Examples of such containers would be time, space, intention, and sculptural forms. The performative action itself was an act of public stream-of-consciousness writing, contained and controlled by the sound of a metronome and the length of the paper across the physical space. The final performance took place surrounded by installation pieces I created using the written material on paper throughout the month of residency.
