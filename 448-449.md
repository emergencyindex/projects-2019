“At the Cusp of One Thing and Another” is about an individual and her relationship to the strong, joyous, monstrous, vile, and beautiful array of what it means to be female / female identifying. The work begins with a single woman changing her outfit to don a conductors’ jacket. She moves in a rectangle of a proscenium space shaking, breaking, thrashing. As the work continues the she is joined in the performance space by 27 other women ages ranging from seventeen to seventy-two years old. After stillness, they too begin to vigorously shake. What emotions result from watching physical raucousness? In developing this piece it felt necessary, and a bit crazy, to have a large group of female bodies claiming space and proclaiming self ownership. I am unabashedly grateful and appreciative to the women who shared the stage with me. This work is about going beyond simple binary options and exploring the many things that make up each individual’s gender identity.
