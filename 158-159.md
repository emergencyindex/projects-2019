Illusions & Portals

Cayla Skillin-Brauchle

“” was a field experiment and series of brief performances in which the artist used the velocity of the wind, pieces of fabric, her body, and a self-timer camera to create millisecond-long visual illusions.

These illusions served as physical and intellectual training to begin to understand concepts of transformation, flight, transfiguration, and flexibility. As such, each iteration is a visualization of and possible portal to future worlds.
