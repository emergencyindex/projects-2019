Lover Boy (I am a vase for flowers)

Connor Certa

I entered the room wearing a black suit. I removed a rose from a vase and placed it into my jacket pocket. I turned to the audience and said, “Think about your favorite song. May I have this dance?” I danced alone to no music. I removed the rose from my jacket pocket and began to rip the petals off, one by one. When there was nothing more of the rose, I removed my clothing and placed dirt in my mouth. I planted the roses into my mouth and watered them. This caused me to choke, vomiting the roses onto the floor, my throat pierced by the thorns. I repeated this several times, then scooped the dirt and roses from the floor and planted them into a glass vase. I left the room.

This piece was a meditation on experiences that I have had with past lovers, the act of nurturing and supporting someone and then the eventual pain felt after they discard me, no longer finding any use for me.
