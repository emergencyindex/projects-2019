Multiples

Kaleob

I exist in organized chaos.

“Multiples” is a performance project where I collect objects, sometimes hundreds of them, to frame the self-portraits shot by Marcus Menefee. The clothing choices reflect both my personality and the objects, ranging from tires to chairs to even flames. The project plays out on Instagram, building fictional personas with ridiculous situations. Online egos are rampant on social media platforms, only showing altered or exaggerated views of ourselves meant to draw attention or win approval. Why not run with it? We are building the mythical man, this trouble maker, who starts fires just to put them out.
