“Mother Death Life Mama : Climate Immigrants” was a poetic, seven-person, site-specific performance procession through the streets of Washington, DC. This performance was a combination of two ongoing bodies of work: “Mother Death Life Mama,” a meditation on our human relationship to nature via our own mortality, and “Climate Immigrants,” a consideration of the impending plight of climate-induced human displacement.

It was a surreal sight to witness, a procession to mark this moment in time while quietly charging the streets of DC. At times the completely empty streets created an eerie yet beautiful post-apocalyptic backdrop highlighting a triumphant and colorful Mother Nature leading a group of marching Climate-Immigrants to The Reach.
