“The Dissolution of Meaning” is a performance of media commentary. Spliced fragments of news interviews were scattered, then sequenced to create an audio collage revealing underlying issues of subjectivity, sensationalism, framing, and bias. Subjects, shifting from one sentence to the next, are followed by unexpected verbs and predicates. Sentences flow with natural cadence and proper syntax, thereby imparting a sense of sonic familiarity. The audio is edited to the point where the original news is completely obscured, and a coherent narrative fails to coalesce. Since context and subject matter are disassembled, signifiers dangle without the signified.

The performer walks onstage carrying a newspaper and portable radio, which is placed on a pedestal next to a chair. Sitting down, the performer briefly reads the newspaper and then turns the knob of the radio. This is the cue for the edited news audio to begin playing and for the audience to begin listening. The audience watches as the performer reads headlines, skims the articles, and periodically turns the pages. With the lack of an introduction or any explanatory materials, the audience must make sense of the performance by listening and watching the performer. The audience is then watching the performer listening, thus mirroring their own media consumption habits back to them. The performance does not supply any of the missing context nor suggest possible interpretations. After the last edited news segment concludes, the performer folds the newspaper, turns off the radio, takes both objects, and walks offstage.
