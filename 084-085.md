Eunjung and Burong’s collaborative project “Sit and Wait and Be Sweet” is a live performance about becoming a predator that makes a trap and is trapped simultaneously. Instead of discarding indigestible bubble gum residue, we use fingers, lips, tongues, and saliva to create viscous lines and webs on each other’s bodies. Experimenting with recycling sticky gum waste and making art from the garbage we produce, the two female bodies together intend to make live, mutable, abject art that cannot be consumed nor digested.

As the second most prolific street litter, gum waste costs $14 billion around the world to clean each year. A popular consumable, gum usually contains residue plastic materials developed by American industries in the 1960s. The very act of chewing gum offers no nutrition but a fleeting sensorial pleasure that remains as trash. Created using slow minimal movement, the gum mesh slowly forms to reference the symbolic social and psychological state of humanity entangled by the non-biodegradable waste they produce.

The performance contains two female bodies, bubble gum colour T-shirts, pink lighting and other visual elements dominated by pink, the sickly sweet smell from chewing strawberry flavoured gum, and the soundtrack “Tongue Thing” composed by Garry Scott James.
