In this three hour performance, I became the Professor and offered a free consultation inside the museum to anyone who wanted to see their life change in 2019 and attain immediate success. My exclusive offer was to solve any problem, which included art problems. The offer was for one day only, and it was printed for several days as an ad in the Jornal de Noticias (a Portuguese newspaper). Attendees who read the ad arrived to see “The Shaman Beatriz Albuquerque” in hopes that she would solve their problems: love, marriage, infidelity, gambling, addiction, weight loss, depression, and more. The audience entered a ritualistic space with ceramic objects and fabric, surrounded by marble sculptures. I wore colorful clothes and a wooden handmade necklace. One of the persons interacting said, “I am one of your competitors and I read tarot cards. What are you reading now?” My answer was, “I am reading the water.”
