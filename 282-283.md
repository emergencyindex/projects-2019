Emotional Labour

Giulia Mattera

Emotional labour is the need to suppress your own emotions, specifically to fit and be accepted in your work context. This durational performance analyses the delicacy, precarity, and vulnerability of working in the art world and in this society in large.

While coexisting in the same small tub with an albine axolotl (an endangered aquatic salamander) for two and a half hours, the artist puts her body at the risk of toxic chemicals released by the axolotl, while the fear towards the axolotl transforms into a playful relationship.

P.S. The axolotl is named Lolita.
