Nodrissx / Narcissx

Dorian Wood

I sat in a chair in the center of a darkened room, covered from head to toe in a cloth, with a slit that exposed my left breast. There was a microphone propped in front of my face. Throughout the course of five hours, event attendees were invited to kneel in front of me and suckle on my breast. Attendees were allowed to suckle for as long as they wanted, but any other physical interaction was not permitted, and my collaborator Bryatt Bryant was present to ensure that no one violated this rule. During the performance installation, I vocalized continuously with a four-channel soundscape created solely by my own voice.

My presence and invitation succeeded in creating an environment of nurturing and chaos.
