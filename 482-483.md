Los 10 más pedidos

Luisho Díaz

“Los 10 más pedidos” was presented on the 2019 Uruguayan National Heritage Day, which had music as a general topic. The performance consisted of reciting ten songs as if they were poems. The script was structured as a Top Ten musical ranking. All the songs recited belonged to the genre Cumbia Villera, which emerged during the last big economic crisis in Argentina and Uruguay between 2000 and 2003. This genre reflected the tumultuous reality of both countries, and the songs focused on violence, poverty, drugs, sex, toxic relationships, rage against the system, murdering, etc. Despite the heavy themes, these songs were played at nightclubs and matinees. I grew up, as a teenager, dancing to that.

By undressing the songs, leaving only the lyrics, my intention was to focus on it’s content of complaint and to reflect on what those songs tell us of that tumultuous period of time in which they were written.
