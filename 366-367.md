We come from an intense, dense urban environment where our bodies exist within and between large architectural structures. We are constantly bombarded by a plethora of physical sensations and sounds. We know who we are in this place, but we are also aware of a loss of deep connection with what is elemental and untamed. We travel 1,997 miles to alter our perceptions.

Abandonment to Risk and Landscape:

In this new place that is completely unfamiliar to us spatially and sonically, we place ourselves on the ground, where structure is created by time, atmosphere, and the natural world.

Distance and Intimacy:

We practice using patterned walking and vocalizations to establish relationships with the landscape, each other, and ourselves. Our work is both aleatory and fiercely focused. We move in the middle and we sing in the middle and we are in the middle between up and down, the earth and the sky. Here is a picture for you.
