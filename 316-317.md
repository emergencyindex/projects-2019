Mallory Catlett / Restless NYC

William Burroughs’ Nova Trilogy is both an intergalactic fever dream on addiction and a manual for a weaponized media war that predicts and satirizes our current online life. “DECODER: Ticket that Exploded” reimagines the second book of Burroughs’ trilogy as a live performance of broken media hallucinations, living text cut up, and full frequency psychedelia spun from mangled audio tape. At the center of the performance is the tape recorder, the analog device Burroughs himself used, which is connected to an array of digital sensors to create the cut-up machine he predicted. The cassette-tape DJ and sound artist G Lucas Crane and performer Jim Findlay bring The Machine to life, acting as both fictional characters and real-time systems operators, decoding the present by cutting in episodes of Burroughs’ 1960s space odyssey. The work features noisey image meals and kaleidoscopic dreamscapes made from internet debris by video designer Keith Skretch, with interaction design by Ryan Holsopple. Created and directed by Mallory Catlett / Restless NYC, DECODER is a collaboration with tape DJ and sound artist G. Lucas Crane, performer Jim Findlay, video designer Keith Skretch, interaction designer Ryan Holsopple, and Burroughs scholar Alex Wermer-Colan.
