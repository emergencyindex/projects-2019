Suture the Future (Marval A Fuck)

Marval A Rex

“Suture the Future (Marval A Fuck)” is a choreographed disassemblage of artist Marval A Rex, utilizing elements of Butoh dance theatre, BDSM, burlesque, ceramic art, and a live “noise” show. Rex begins in male drag, and slowly unveils their transgender body in the midst of a ceremonial form of a “ceramics tutorial” involving a ceramic bust of a white male figure. The song Rex sings and then loops is “Never Seen a Girl (Like Me)” by ShitKid. At the end of the performance, Rex is naked, undulating amidst looped sounds, and has successfully pierced himself to white male subjectivity in the form of a ceramic bust, this way implicating and attaching their transmasculine body to the legacy of male representation in Western art history.
