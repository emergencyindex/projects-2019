Bush Ladies Clowning Around, or Recalling the Unseen Infrastructures of Water

Ensayos

 translated the content of a scientific paper, “Toxic effects of polyethylene terephalate microparticles and Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate on the calanoid copepod, Parvocalanus crassirostris,” into the form of a well-known folk song. The rewrite was undertaken in collaboration with ichthyologist Lynne van Herwerden so that her laboratory’s research concerning the human impact on nearby coral reefs could be accessible to the coastal community. During the performance, audience response filled in the blank in the song’s last line. Here is an excerpt from the song. Please sing it, and fill in the blank. It’s a mouthful.

COPEPOD SONG (sung to the tune of “I Know an Old Lady who Swallowed a Fly”)

I woke up this morning and swallowed some plastic

I don’t even know what microplastics are

I hope I don’t die

I woke up this morning and swallowed a copepod

That little guy ate a microplastic for breakfast (instead of a phytoplankton)

Just sucked it right up, into its gut (yeah it got stuck there)

I hope it don’t die

I woke up this morning and swallowed a damselfish

I WISH YOU’D STOP EATING FISH

I swallowed a damselfish that swallowed a fish larva

That’s swimming around in my tummy all salty and gooey

I swallowed a fish larva that swallowed a copepod

That swallowed a microplastic

Instead of a phytoplankton (reducing its chance of survival by 40%)

Are they all gonna die???

I woke up this morning and swallowed a coral trout

Without a doubt I like eating trout

I swallowed a coral trout that swallowed a damselfish that swallowed a fish larva

That’s swimming around in my tummy all salty and gooey

I swallowed a fish larva that swallowed a copepod

That swallowed a microplastic for breakfast instead of a phytoplankton

At the base of the food web

We’re all gonna die…
