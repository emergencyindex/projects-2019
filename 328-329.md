Necessary Conditions

Emily DiCarlo

To perceptually experience time standing still, keep pace with the setting sun when cruising at an altitude of 35,000 feet. Transcendence only comes when the necessary conditions are in place: a minimum speed of 500 knots, a westward direction and a flight path above the 56th parallel north. During my month-long residency at Korpúlstaðir SÍM Residency in Reykjavik, Iceland, residing just below the Arctic Circle, I mobilized this concept by coupling a text-based work with a daily performance in which I stencilled the day’s sunset time each morning on a custom-made postcard embossed with the listed necessary conditions. The postcard acting as my surrogate, I then walked into town to airmail it, as a romantic conceptual gesture, sending it westward back to a Toronto-based gallery for later exhibition.
