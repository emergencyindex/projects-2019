Balance

Marisa Lewon

“Balance” is a 55min performance that includes a nine foot wooden seesaw and nearly 100 handmade sandbags that create a transitional environment to enact feelings of both anxiety and equilibrium. Focusing on themes of displacement, I use personal narratives to express spaces of comfort and discomfort. Futilely tracing my way back through my life, I divided the sandbags up to represent the landscapes I have lived in. Delicately placing the bags on either side, I filled the seesaw up to the brim and then continued until they were all placed on the structure, allowing them to spill onto the floor as gravity took its toll. Gently I returned all of the bags back to a pile at the front of the gallery, cleaned off and rebalanced the structure, and left the space as calmly as I entered. The space was then left to allow viewers to interact with as they saw fit for the two weeks that followed the performance. Each individual got to experience a unique space that can never be perfectly replicated, allowing their personal experience and history to urge them to interact with, or avoid, the work left in front of them.
