“Pathologies of the Image” is a requiem for the artworks. It consists of singers singing a cappella a list of pathologies that art pieces suffer or could suffer, that is to say, the substances, environmental conditions, parasites, accidents, etc. that affect and destroy images (whether they be analogue or digital).

“Pathologies of the Image” underlines the immateriality of the art work precisely through its materiality, turning all the factors which destroy an artwork into the artwork itself. It’s a statement for an immaterial art piece. A performance based on one of the most ephemeral materials: the voice.

Depending on the context, the performance could adopt different compatible forms:

1) as a performance with a choir (4 singers or more)

2) as a guided visit to an exhibition: one singer goes from work to work commenting on their singularities, and enumerating the different pathologies that each piece suffers or could suffer

3) as a sound installation: sound of recorded voices singing to be played in the installation and music sheet
