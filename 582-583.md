I sat on a stool in a restaurant for an hour with my ass out reading “I’m sending love in all directions” on my visible underpants. Occasionally I would make noises or say “I’m sending love in all directions.” The intention was to send love in all directions no matter what I thought, felt, or experienced. A problem is I don’t always feel like sending love in all directions, and I don’t always sound or talk like I am sending love in all directions; however, I’d like everyone to know that I intend to do so. I’m working with the intention to send love in all directions. I printed the underwear with the phrase as a reminder, and the purpose of this #dutyfreeranger performative public intervention was to remind everyone that we all can send love in all directions, and sometimes we are sending love in all directions whether we know it or not! Interactions with passersby were limited to glances or looks. Nothing really happened except, I sent love in all directions for an hour, and let it be known.

Duty Free Ranger projects destabilize colonialism, militarism, and complacency via interventions I call fashion actions, using public space as a performative stage where anything can happen. These public interventions create moments of surprise in public space, awakening passersby on their day to day paths.
