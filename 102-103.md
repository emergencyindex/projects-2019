Before the performance the women were asked to cover their bodies in turmeric-colored bentonite clay and to smother it over their bodies. Upon performance time they entered into the gallery room that was painted Happy Top Banana Yellow on the floor and walls. The women were given a guideline score ahead of time. They were asked to alternate between free movement exploration throughout the room, with pauses in which someone initiates the guidance towards a collective stance that has everyone representing a feeling of unity and togetherness. The performance lasted three hours. By the end the clay was crusted on their bodies and the walls. The women were fatigued but energized. It was an exploration of the body, mind, collectiveness, and connection with ourselves and with each other.
