Homemade

Teena Wilder

In “Homemade” I tapdance and smash soda cans for twenty-five minutes wearing shoes made from a pair of Mary Janes, held together by hair and clothespins. About four minutes into the performance the shoes completely fall apart, but I continue to dance, only stopping twice to wash and cut my hair or to dip my feet in a pot of water.

The performance explores the body as a teller of stories, critiquing the visibility of black labor and trauma as a source of entertainment for the white gaze, and viewing washing as an act of translating information (ex. Baptism and The Middle Passage). I consider the body as a material made from home, the same way the shoes are made. The sound for the performance is audio of myself and my mother speaking about my father sexually assaulting me.
