Daily reflection

Natacha Voliakovsky

I buy the newspaper of the day in New York. I read it. I select the news that is oppresive towards the corporalities of Latino immigrants, women, and non-binary identities. I rip the news that legitimizes this kind of thinking in American society.

I put the pieces of paper one by one inside my mouth and start chewing them. I absorb the ink as if I could absorb its symbolic meaning. The paper is not degraded, nor what it contains. I keep introducing news in my mouth. One by one until the newspaper ends. I can barely close my mouth but I keep chewing. I have a big news bolus in my mouth. I keep chewing for a while. I take the bolus out of my mouth and leave it on the floor.
