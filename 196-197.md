From my ongoing anti-baseball cap work. The monologue speaks for itself.

A baseball cap is on the floor.

“Look here!”

Point at baseball cap.

“A RELIC OF THE ARENA,

A TOKEN OF MASCULINITY,

AN EMBLEM OF ACCEPTABILITY,

AN ASSERTION OF CONFORMITY,

A MONUMENT TO AMERICAN CULTURAL IMPERIALISM,

A CROWN OF OPPRESSION—

I PISS ON THIS!”

Urinate on baseball cap.
