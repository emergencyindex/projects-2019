Climate Grief

Tamara Wyndham

I start by describing the heartbreaking effects of ecological disaster: worldwide forest fires, floods, drought, pollution, mass extinctions. The performance comes to a climax with rending my clothing, and covering myself with paint: first grey, then red, while crying out. Then I collapsed onto a cloth, imprinting a body print. Arising, I called for unity:

“We will face this together

We will work together

We will fight together

We will be there for each other, and for the earth.

Together we will find a way.”

The audience chanted with me. Eric Gonzalez-Blitz played percussion accompanying the performance.

This performance of “Climate Grief” was created for a benefit for the Sane Energy Project.
