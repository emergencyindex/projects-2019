“Puppets Forsaken” is an acoustic noise collaboration between Natali Leduc and David Gifford, investigating the forgotten sounds of Luigi Russolo’s intonarumori. In 2019 we built a series of sculptural noise generators and played them for various audiences, from academics at a theory symposium to aficionados at a noise underground club, and to an audience of fallen trees and stumps in a clear cut area next to an old growth forest (Carmanah Walbran Provincial Park, BC, Canada).

To begin these performances, we invite a volunteer to lie down on a pink carpet between our two largest noise generators and the volunteer stays there throughout the set. The sounds are mostly produced by moving cranks and levers that are rubbing on piano strings inside the wooden boxes of various devices. We also have a chair that is very squeaky.

The length of the performance is about twenty minutes. There is no score, we try to improvise, and we only ever theorize about practicing.

We are nostalgic about Futurism because they were more optimistic back then about the future.
