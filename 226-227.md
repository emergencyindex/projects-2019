Untitled (Cruelty)

Ivana Larrosa

In “Untitled (Cruelty)” I investigate the impact of space in the construction of the self and the ways of seeing in relation to a car accident which left me with permanent double vision in 2002. I roll inside a big black trash bag until my breath is heavily difficult. At that moment, the lights switch off and the public hears my asphyxiating breathing combined with the friction of the plastic on my body.

I aim to explore endurance and emotional embodiment along with the notion of identity through the body and its limits. Because trauma eradicates the memory as representation, in its place comes the perception. The presentation of the experience where the audience becomes the mediator constitutes a process of reworking the emotion that allows movement from trauma to the idea of an event as cathartic.
