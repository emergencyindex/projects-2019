An action that thinks about ways of being together.

First performed by four artists walking together through Cardiff city center, from the house of one person to the train station where another was getting the train home. We had been talking about working together as an artist group that wasn’t bound by a physical space that day.

Walking in a line we placed our hands in the coat pocket of the person, next to us—the two people in the middle of the line had both hands, one each in a different person’s pocket.

Bound physically as a group, we negotiated the environment as we walked together.

This has been repeated with different numbers of people, in instances when working together or being together has been of importance.
