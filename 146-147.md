“Oldwives and Orbits” was a twenty-minute durational performance that blended the knowledge of oldwives in an attempt to ponder the creation of new planets and put them into orbit. My mother taught me to sew and cook. We would put bread in our mouths while cutting onions to absorb the scent of the onion and prevent crying. By using fabric sewing techniques, I meticulously cut apart each layer of an onion, sewed them back together individually, and put them in orbit on an orrery (a mechanical model of the solar system) made from an altered rotisserie motor (typically used to roast chickens). “Oldwives and Orbits” intertwines forms of domestic labor and storytelling to speculate about planetary futures.
