The original performance happened at a show I do every year where I invite all family, friends, and others to watch the pieces I created that year. This show was entitled “Jerky to Juicy” and used drawings, video, songs, poems, games, and monologues to explore the historical hunger for humanity. It began with the creation and use of God as a “catchall” for mystery and motivation for goodness. Science now fulfills that role, and this has benefits and consequences. I originally wrote “Leftover Love” to my mother, who loved and abused me. As I refined it, the piece resonated with many of my relationships both big and small. I think it can be an ignition or anthem for anyone in an asymmetric relationship who needs to reassert her self-worth. I broke the silence with a slow, steady beat against my chest that increased faster and faster until I punctured it with my words. It was somber and beautiful.
