The simple action of placing an empty plastic container on the rear wheel of a bicycle to create noise while rolling up and down the streets can take us back to our childhoods. In this performance, dozens of cyclists were summoned to descend the helical ramps of the wooden structure of the Phonographic Pavilion designed by the architect Mauricio Rocha Iturbide for the exhibition “Modes of hearing: art and sound practices in Mexico,” organized by the Ex Teresa Arte Actual. Each bicycle created a different vibration frequency due to the friction of the wheels against different types of plastic containers, creating an array of enveloping sounds. We created a surrounding, spiraling sound throughout the space of the main gallery of the Museum. The performance lasted the equivalent of a music score divided into three intervals, which I improvised during the collective performance. To that effect, I indicated to the cyclists at what moment they should begin their route and the speed during the descent, in order to create different intervals of movement and sound.
