Lime Rickey International’s Future Faith

Leyya Mona Tawil

“Lime Rickey International’s Future Faith” is a conceptual performance work composed, choreographed, and performed by transdisciplinary artist Leyya Mona Tawil, made of eleven interwoven statements which are transmitted via bilingual lyrics, spatial choreographies, fictional folk dances, and a noise score generated by voice, microphones and effects to a future nation, a homeland not yet born.

“Future Faith’’ is the culmination of a multi-year investigation into Arab Experimentalism, a field that narrates regional and diasporic realities through transgressive arts practices. Lime Rickey International is the “alter ego” of Leyya Mona Tawil, her container for narrating current realities in the global Arab diaspora via “future folkdances” built with elements of contemporary dance, Arabic folk forms (specifically dabke and tarab), sound art and conceptual art practices. Tawil’s work as Lime Rickey International challenges identity ‘legibility’ and champions a queer, feminist perspective of diasporic practices in live art.

The premiere of this work received a nomination for a Bessie Award in Music 2019, and was highlighted in Artforum International, the New Yorker and the New York Times. Dance Enthusiast described it as “folk-dance-meets-club-dance choreography” with “ecstatic, trance-like possibilities of rhythm and repetition”.
