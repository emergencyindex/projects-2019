“Ain’t I a Woman (?/!): Dusk Chronicles II” is a durational piece inspired by the movie “Daughters of the Dust.” It confronts the narrative of “anti-blackness” that exists in American society. The durational performance consisted of me being doused in “Aunt Jemimah Pancake Mix” for three hours in front of an audience.

The audience was silent, moving in and out of the space while I was rolling around in the pancake mix. Then I decided to leave the designated space and venture into the other parts of the gallery confronting visitors with a question: “Do you see yourselves in me?” Most of the visitors stood quiet and waited until I passed by. But one visitor, a young Asian woman, looked aghast at me and cried out “NO!” I sulked and slowly walked away from her, back to the main part of the gallery where my exhibit took place. I covered myself in more pancake mix, shielding myself from the rest of the audience; losing myself in ritual until I uttered “Am I white enough for you?” No one replied. Slowly the rest of the audience got up and left save for one white, middle-aged gentleman who stayed the whole three-hour performance.
