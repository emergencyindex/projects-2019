Cloud Interludes

Claire Bronchick

“Cloud Interludes” proposes an interruption of the order of day-to-day life. With a small team of collaborators, clouds (performers with cloud heads) descended into various parts of Westchester County, NY as temporary residents of the area. As they drifted slowly through everyday locations—a local beach, wooded walking paths, various areas around a college campus such as the library or a homecoming basketball game—they created moments of shared wonder, laughter, and confusion with their out-of-place and whimsical presence. Spectators took photos of them to share on social media, and they looked around at each other as if to ask, “Are you seeing what I’m seeing?”

The clouds’ slowness and lack of purpose run counter to the fast-moving pace of modern life. To take our time, to share free joy with others, is inherently critical of a capitalist system that stresses profit over contemplation or unproductive behavior such as daydreaming. “Cloud Interludes” invites us to appreciate our surroundings, to open ourselves to other people and to other possibilities of living… in other words, to look up and look around!
