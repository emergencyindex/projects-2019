Red Triangle

Madysen Koontz

“Red Triangle” is a defamiliarization of the pulse. I stood barefoot outside in a 4’ x 4’ square, marked with black tape. Participants were invited to pick up a 2” x 4” paper with instructions. The instructions read: “Step into black square Remain inside Feel Red Triangle’s pulse All May exit after Red Triangle exits.” On my neck in wet red paint was a triangle. Participants placed their fingers on the Red Triangle, and were left with paint on their fingertips. As the piece progressed, space within the square became cramped and the movement to reach Red Triangle grew difficult. The piece makes the learned comfort of a pulse violent and distressing. “Red Triangle” confronts the normalcy of actions by providing an equally true unsettling perspective.
