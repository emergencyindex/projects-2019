Heart Beats

Arezoo Moseni

Art is the arena where I have the freedom to do the impossible. The most significant aspect of being an artist is the transformative experience of making the work and sharing it with viewers from all walks of life. For me the concept of the invisible relates to the world of dreams as one envisions concepts and events in the fourth dimension. The invisible also reminds me of what Antoine de Saint-Exupery said: “It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye,” as well as the novel “Invisible Man” where Ralph Ellison wrote: “I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.”

The full text of “The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights” was featured in one of my previous projects in 2001. The current cultural and societal climate urged me to feature the UNDHR text in my Art in Odd Places Festival project “Heart Beats,” which consisted of two parts. An ankle length poncho that has the UNDHR text on its front and back. The poncho was worn by me and publicly displayed as I walked on 14th Street from Avenue C to 11th Avenue. The second part of the performance referenced the notion of manifesting the invisible with photographs as I made Fujiroid images of the artists and the crowd participating in the Art in Odd Places Festival. The rewarding aspect of my performance was when I lost count of the passersby who approached me to learn more about “The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.”
