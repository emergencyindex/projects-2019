The duration of “Paper Glasses” is around twelve minutes. In the first scene, the character (Ali Fathollahi) enters the scene struggling to push a heavy box inside the scene. Then he starts pulling books and tools out of the box and seems to engage in a building process. After a few seconds, the viewers realize what the performer is doing, which is drilling holes in books and tying them with string pieces. Following, the performer wears one book on his face like glasses or a mask. The act continues with the performer turning more and more books into glasses and wearing them one on top of another. It gets to the point that the weight of books gravitates the performer’s head toward the ground and he no longer can support his head normally. At the end, the performer is crawling on the ground with a stack of books tied to his face pushing the box out of the scene to exit.

This performance, like other works done by this artist, Ali Fathollahi, has an edge of humor which keeps the audience entertained while triggering a thinking process in their heads. The main concept targets the wrong way of utilizing knowledge and information by some in which no growth is achieved. Instead, the gained knowledge weighs one down as the information has never been processed properly and just accumulated on the surface. It works as a blinding filter that one sees the world though, resulting in becoming less and less receptive of truth.
