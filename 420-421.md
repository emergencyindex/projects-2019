“Yellow-White Baked” renders the modern Chinese standards of female beauty as it has been influenced by Western capitalist society. With the modern population’s obsession with Western lifestyle, facial enhancements become more prominent, from the perfect nose to the perfect jawline. These obsessions fuel modern beauty standards to move towards Western perfection. This piece consists of facial attachments that change the artist’s real facial features, such as an enhanced high-bridge nose, double eyelids, fine thick lips, porcelain skin color, and strands of blond hair. All these characteristics embody the cultural shifts to globalization that is dependent on the obsession with Western beauty.

“Yearning Support” plays with the stereotypical pose of the Asian squat. This term came from the common posture which is a generalized action of the Asian population. The piece questions the origin of this posture, the cultural norms of etiquette, and the posture’s deep roots in the lower / middle class population. The action of the Asian squat differs as migration happens throughout the world, and is refined and shifted away from the proper mannerisms in the West. “Yearning Support” embellishes a stool with the functionality to caress the squatter.
