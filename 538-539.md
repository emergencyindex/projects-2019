Humano Ressonante Amarelo

Luluca L

I conceived of “Humano Ressonante Amarelo” as a sensorial and relational piece of art, a three-dimensional, living, and transconceptual installation, that would be freestanding in the exhibition spaces and require the spectator’s participation. However, after building this work for two exhibitions, its construction turned out to be as performative and potent as the object itself.

The action lasted almost three hours. With some assistance, I covered myself in a layer of plastic wrap, covering everything but my head. Then, I did another layer with reflective aluminized tape. To get out of this new skin, I cut a few corners. After that, I repeated the procedure for my head and reassembled it all as “Humano Ressonante Amarelo.” My kin. It is a work about (self) acceptance and empathy.

Curatorial text: Andressa Cantergiani.

“A skin that opens inward and reveals a void, a hollow, or an open body. Random body. A way that is rebellious to any form of figuration, which resists coding. A body that can also be lived as a door to the non-form, to the unconditioned.”

Concept text: The Tzolkin’s Holy Matrix of ancient Maya.

I channel in order to influence

Inspiring wisdom

I seal the process of free will

With the resonant tone of harmonization

I am guided by the power of flowering

I’m a galactic activation portal, come in for me
