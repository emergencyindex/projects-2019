Spiral of Spirits

Chikyu to the Moon

“Spiral of Spirit” is a Japanese Yosakoi-inspired contemporary dance. We worked with pure movement and used circular patterns and rotating cannons. As we danced, we represented the spiraling journey into finding love and joy through unity and the universal language of dance.
