Solo

Emilie Franceschin

In this performance, I deal with the question of how to define performance art. In this configuration of stage space, I try to transform the notion of the show. Through various actions such as singing and dancing, I try to center not the technical performance but the essence of the action as experienced by the body. I spit while singing “Non je ne regrette rien,” by Edith Piaf. (I have never taken singing lessons.) I try to hold a classical dance step during the time of the classical music piece. I’ve never taken a dance class.

The last part of the performance also refers to the place in which this performance occurs, in Spain. Through the garments I wear and the actions I perform, I directly transpose visual codes: red and yellow, which give weight to certain signs identifiable to Spain.
