For “Easy As A Wipe,” I presented a vinyl-encased quilt in the manner of an infomercial. Throughout the three hour performance, I cleaned the quilt with spray and paper towels, espousing its abilities to keep users safe from intruders, germs, bad energy, and a variety of other ailments. I demonstrated a variety of uses of the quilt, at times wrapping it around myself, as one would use a blanket, exercising, meditating, and even sleeping.

This is a study in cleaning. Cleaning the self of biological, mental, physical, and spiritual intrusions, and the absurdity of such actions. Humans cannot survive in a vacuum or without rich ecosystems (both physically or mentally), yet we bleach and burn the landscape around us in an effort to colonize space with only our ordered bodies and those we permit.
